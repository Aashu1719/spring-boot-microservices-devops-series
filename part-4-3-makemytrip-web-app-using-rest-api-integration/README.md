# MakeMyTripApp - Spring Boot REST API Integration Project

This is a web-based Spring Boot project that simulates a basic travel booking interface, similar to MakeMyTrip. The application consumes an external REST API (IRCTC Ticket Booking API) using Spring's `RestTemplate`. Users can submit passenger details and view booked tickets through a user-friendly Thymeleaf interface.

## ðŸ”— API Integration Details

- **POST `/ticket`** â€“ Book a ticket by sending passenger details as JSON  
- **GET `/tickets`** â€“ Retrieve all booked tickets

These endpoints are consumed from the external IRCTC REST API project running independently.

---

## âœ… How It Works

1. User visits the homepage (`/`)
2. Fills out the booking form and submits
3. Form data is sent to the IRCTC service via `RestTemplate.postForEntity()`
4. Ticket response is displayed on a confirmation page
5. All booked tickets can be viewed via `RestTemplate.getForEntity()`
